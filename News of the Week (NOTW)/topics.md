### Texas man sues three women for helping his ex-wife obtain abortion pills

A Texas man sued three women alleging that they are liable for wrongful death, because they helped his ex-wife
obtain abortion pills in July 2022. He is seeking damages of 1 million dollars against each woman. 

The state of Texas along with about a dozen other states has enacted a state-wide ban on abortion;
according to Texas law it is illegal to '*aid, provide or abet* ' an abortion after 6 weeks. 
The suit alleges: "&lbrack;the defendants&rbrack; all knew that they were aiding &lbrack;…&rbrack; a self-managed abortion, which is a &lbrack;…&rbrack; criminal act of murder under Texas law"

His ex-wife, who divorced her husband in February 2022 was (according to the lawsuit) not a defendant and thus 
exempt from criminal or civil liability under state law.

The plaintiff is represented by Briscoe Cain, a Republican member of the Texas House of Representatives
and Jonathan Mitchell, credited as an architect of the six-week abortion ban in Texas that took effect in September of 2021.

*A hearing in the case has been set for June eighth*.

register as 'foreign agents' or face fines. The bill was supposed to root out &raquo;foreign influences&laquo;
and &raquo;spies&laquo; and was described by opponents as a local version of a russian law that
Putin used to crush dissent for more than a decade.

Although it was modelled on the 1938 "Foreign Agents Registration Act" of the US, that primarily 
covers lobbyists and organisations, directly working under the control of foreign governments.

According to the 32-year-old Nika Oboladze *90% of Georgians support European Integration*.

The same day Carlson aired his Jan. 6 fabrication, Trump said on Sean Hannity’s radio show that he would have been willing to let Vladimir Putin “take over” parts of Ukraine. But when Hannity played excerpts of the interview on Fox News, the network edited out Trump’s proposed surrender.
